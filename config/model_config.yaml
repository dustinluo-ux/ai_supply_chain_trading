# Model Configuration
# Change 'active_model' to switch between models - NO CODE CHANGES NEEDED

# Enable ML model (set to true to use regression, false to use weighted signals)
use_ml: false  # Set to true to enable ML predictions

# Which model to use for predictions
active_model: 'ridge'  # Options: linear, ridge, lasso, xgboost (ridge more robust on small samples)

# Model-specific hyperparameters
models:
  linear:
    # No hyperparameters for basic linear regression
    
  ridge:
    alpha: 0.01  # Regularization strength (Iteration 2: was 1.0, reduced to allow non-zero coefficients)
    
  lasso:
    alpha: 0.1  # Regularization strength (higher = more feature selection)
    
  xgboost:
    n_estimators: 100  # Number of trees
    max_depth: 3       # Tree depth (keep low to avoid overfitting)
    learning_rate: 0.1
    subsample: 0.8     # Row sampling
    colsample_bytree: 0.8  # Feature sampling
    random_state: 42
    
  # Add new models here:
  # random_forest:
  #   n_estimators: 100
  #   max_depth: 5
